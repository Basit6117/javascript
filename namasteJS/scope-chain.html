    <h1>Scope chain</h1>

        //scope in Js is directly related to lexical environment
        //lexical env is local memory plus lexical env of  parent
        // function a(){
        //     console.log(x); // x will be searched in local space if not found it will see outside
        // }
        // x=600;
        // a();

        function c(){
                    var m = "I love Silence"; //is m inside scope of a function
            function f(){
            }
            f();
        }
        c();
        // console.log(m);
        //sccope mean where u access a specific variable or function in our code

        ////////////////////////////////////////Lexical Envirenment//////////
        // whenever an execution context is created  a  LEXICAL ENVIRONMENTIS is also created
        // -------->Lexical environment is the local memory along with  lexical environmment of its parent
        //------------>Lexical is a term means in hirarchy or in a sequence
        //---------------->In above example -- f() -- is lexically inside c() and c() is lexically inside global scope
        //+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
        // +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
        // _____________________________________
        // When execution context is created u also get lexical environment of its parent
        //                   |                        |
        //                   |                        |  
        //                   |       f()[ ***      ]  |    ***(Scope Chain) is assuming refernce to the lexical environment of its parent
        //                   |                        |        so lexical environment of f() is c() b/c f() is lexically inside f()
        //                   |  c() execu [***  f() ] |        so it got access to c() and its lexical envornment which is global scope for c()
        //                   |                        |  
        //                   | global exec [*** c()  ]|
